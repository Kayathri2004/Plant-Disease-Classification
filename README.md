# Plant Disease Classification

**INTRODUCTION**

This project focuses on addressing the challenges of plant disease detection using small and diverse datasets. Leveraging the EfficientNet architecture, the model achieves superior accuracy while minimizing overfitting. It integrates innovative techniques such as early stopping and data augmentation, enabling precise and scalable identification of plant leaf diseases. The primary goal is to improve the efficiency and generalizability of plant disease classification to support sustainable agriculture.

**FEATURES**

* High Accuracy: Utilizes EfficientNet, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture, to achieve robust classification results.
* Regularization Techniques: Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
* Data Augmentation: Enhances dataset diversity by applying transformations like flipping, rotation, and zooming to the training images.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**

* Programming Language: Python
* Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
* Development Environment: Google Colab

**DATASET**

The project uses the Apple Leaf Disease dataset from PlantVillage, comprising 9,714 high-quality images divided into four categories:
1. Healthy
2. Rust
3. Rot
4. Scab
